This Bejeweled bot is a HIGHLY modified version of the bot located at 
http://andrewroycarter.com/c/bejeweled-bot-written-in-c-win32-api/
and http://redd.it/et87y It's basically rewritten from the ground up,
including new features such as heuristics, screen capturing, time limits,
advanced, debugging, cell count, cell size, etc.

Instructions:
Running the bot is very straightforward. Once the program is run, press
any key. The bot will then begin counting down from 5 seconds. The mouse
cursor should be placed at the upper left hand corner of the game board.
Once the count down has completed, the bot will capture the coordinates
from the mouse cursor. Once captured, the bot will begin playing the game.

Notes:
Because the bot isn't perfect, it will sometimes get stuck. If it gets stuck,
it should realize that it is stuck and will ask for help.
